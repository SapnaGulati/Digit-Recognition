# Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition machine learning model.

# Introduction:
Digit recognition is a simple machine learning based project.
Digit recognition project is able to recognize the hand-written digit i.e. 2.
It is based on very small amount of data.

# Train-test Data:
There is data which is divided in two parts:
Training Data: used for the training the model
Testing Data: used for the testing purpose
Testing data confirms is the model working properly or not.

# Purpose:
This model will recognize the hand written digit that can be provided by the user.
It's a very basic project just to start the machine learing.
